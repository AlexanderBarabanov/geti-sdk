Geti™ SDK documentation
======================================

Welcome to the documentation for the Geti™ SDK! The purpose of this SDK is twofold:

#. Provide an easy-to-use interface to the Geti™ platform, to manipulate
   Geti™ projects and other entities or automate tasks on the platform. All
   of this from a Python script or Jupyter notebook.

#. Provide an API to deploy and run models trained on the Geti™ server on your local
   machine. The SDK :py:mod:`~geti_sdk.deployment` module provides a straightforward
   route to create a deployment for your Geti™ project, save it to a local disk and run
   it offline.

This SDK includes various example scripts and Jupyter notebooks which illustrate a
range of use cases for the SDK. Make sure to check them out if you're getting
started!
