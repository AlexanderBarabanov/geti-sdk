SonomaCreek SDK documentation
======================================

Welcome to the documentation for the SonomaCreek SDK! The purpose of this SDK is twofold:

#. Provide an easy-to-use interface to the SonomaCreek platform, to be able to
   manipulate SC projects and other entities or automate tasks on the platform. All of this
   from a python script or Jupyter notebook.

#. Provide an API to deploy and run models trained in SonomaCreek on your local
   machine. The SDK :py:mod:`~sc_api_tools.deployment` module provides a straightforward
   route to create a deployment for your SC project, save it to local disk and run it offline.
