Intel® Geti™ SDK documentation
======================================

Welcome to the documentation for the Intel® Geti™ SDK! The purpose of this SDK is twofold:

#. Provide an easy-to-use interface to the Intel® Geti™ platform, to be able to
   manipulate Intel® Geti™ projects and other entities or automate tasks on the platform. All
   of this from a python script or Jupyter notebook.

#. Provide an API to deploy and run models trained on the Intel® Geti™ server on your local
   machine. The SDK :py:mod:`~geti_sdk.deployment` module provides a straightforward
   route to create a deployment for your Intel® Geti™ project, save it to local disk and run
   it offline.

This SDK includes various example scripts and jupyter notebooks which illustrate a
range of use cases for the SDK. Make sure to check them out if you're getting
started!
