Intel GETi SDK documentation
======================================

Welcome to the documentation for the GETi SDK! The purpose of this SDK is twofold:

#. Provide an easy-to-use interface to the GETi platform, to be able to
   manipulate GETi projects and other entities or automate tasks on the platform. All
   of this from a python script or Jupyter notebook.

#. Provide an API to deploy and run models trained in GETi on your local
   machine. The SDK :py:mod:`~geti_sdk.deployment` module provides a straightforward
   route to create a deployment for your GETi project, save it to local disk and run
   it offline.
