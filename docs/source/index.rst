SonomaCreek SDK documentation
======================================

Welcome to the documentation for the SonomaCreek SDK! The purpose of this SDK is twofold:

1. Provide an easy-to-use interface to the SonomaCreek platform, to be able to
manipulate SC projects and other entities or automate tasks on the platform. All of this
from a python script or Jupyter notebook.
2. Provide an API to deploy and run models trained in SonomaCreek on your local
machine. The SDk :py:mod:`~sc_api_tools.deployment` module provides a straightforward
route to create a deployment for your SC project, save it to local disk and run it offline.
