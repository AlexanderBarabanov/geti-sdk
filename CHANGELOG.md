# Intel® Geti™ SDK v0.2.0

This is the first official release of the Intel® Geti™ Software Development Kit (SDK).

The purpose of this SDK is twofold:

1. Provide an easy-to-use interface to the [Intel® Geti™ platform](www.geti.intel.com), to manipulate
Intel® Geti™ projects and other entities or automate tasks on the platform. All
of this from a Python script or Jupyter notebook.


2. Provide an API to deploy and run models trained on the Intel® Geti™ server on your local
machine. The SDK Deployment module provides a straightforward
route to create a deployment for your Intel® Geti™ project, save it to a local disk and run
it offline.

This SDK includes various example scripts and Jupyter notebooks which illustrate a
range of use cases for the SDK. Make sure to check them out if you're getting
started!
